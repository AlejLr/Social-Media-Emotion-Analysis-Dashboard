115630629492210579,mastodon,ai_workspace@social.mikala.one,"2026年投資展望會 投資策略展望 成長趨勢化解高基期、高評價疑慮, 台股衝高後整理 無📌 Summary: 兆豐國際投顧於 2025 年 11 月 26 日發布的《2026 年投資展望會》報告指出，在全球經濟面臨「高基期、兩極化」的挑戰下，美國與全球經濟預計將維持低度穩定成長，但台灣因基期因素，GDP 成長將明顯下滑。儘管總經環境有所放緩，但由於 AI（人工智慧）等新興科技所帶動的強勁成長趨勢，將可化解市場對高基期和高評價的疑慮。報告預期 2026 年台股走勢將呈現「漲多高檔箱型整理」的格局，區間落在 26,000 點至 31,000 點之間。在總體經濟方面，預估 2026 年全球經濟成長維持低度穩定，美國實質 GDP 將呈現緩步走升趨勢，但美國的消費者物價指數（CPI）預期在 2026 年底前仍明顯高於聯準會（FED）的目標區。台灣方面，2025 年出口及外銷訂單成長強勁，尤其資通訊與電子零組件貢獻最大，但這也同時墊高了 2026 年的基期。基本面顯示成長趨勢不變，但評價已偏高。S\&P 500 整體企業獲利在 2026 年預估仍樂觀，主要成長動能來自科技、原物料和工業類股，其中科技類股預估獲利成長率達 23.5%。台股上市櫃公司在經歷 2025 年的復甦後，預估 2026 年稅後淨利年增率將加速至約 15.8%。然而，無論是美股 S\&P 500 的實際本益比（P/E）或預估本益比，均位於歷史或區間上緣的水準，台股的股價淨值比（PBR）和本益比也已突破區間上緣。此外，台股的「巴菲特指標」（總市值/GDP 比值）大幅高於全球主要股市。題材方面，AI 泡沫被認為尚在醞釀過程，主要大型 CSP 公司如微軟（Microsoft）、甲骨文（Oracle）等剩餘履約義務（RPO）多來自 OpenAI。但報告同時指出，主要 CSP 公司的資本支出（Capex）預估增速將在 2026 年放緩。在籌碼方面，外資呈現「高出低進」的策略，投信自 2025 年 7 月、外資自 2025 年 10 月起轉為賣超。不過，證券劃撥餘額大幅創高，顯示市場資金動能依然強勁。技術分析則顯示，加權指數長多慣性不變，但短線將面臨漲多逢壓整理，波段漲勢近尾聲。🎯 Key Points: - 🔴 總體經濟與大盤展望： - 全球成長： 預估 2026 年全球經濟維持低度穩定成長，美國 GDP 緩步走升。 - 通膨壓力： 美國 CPI 年增率預計在 2026 年結束前仍將明顯高於 FED 2.0% 的目標區。 - 台灣基期： 由於 2025 年出口及訂單成長強勁，墊高了 2026 年的基期。 - 大盤區間： 預期台股 2026 年將呈現「漲多高檔箱型整理」，規劃區間為 26,000 點至 31,000 點。 - 季度事件（利多）： 26Q2 有 FOMC 降息（6/17）與 COMPUTEX 股東會行情。26Q3 有 NVIDIA 的 RUBIN 伺服器出貨。 - 💰 企業基本面與評價： - 美股獲利： S\&P 500 企業 2026 年獲利預估仍樂觀，預計獲利成長率為 12.5%。 - 美股成長動能： 主要來自 科技（23.5%）、通訊服務（22.0%）和金融（13.2%）類股（2026 年預估獲利成長率）。 - 台股獲利： 預估 2026 年上市櫃公司稅後淨利年增率將加速至 15.8%。 - 評價警訊（偏高）： - S\&P 500 實際與預估本益比（P/E Ratio）均位於歷史偏上或區間上緣水準。 - 台股 PBR（股價淨值比）大幅創高，PER（本益比）也突破區間上緣。 - 台股巴菲特指標（總市值/GDP 比值）大幅高於全球主要股市。 - 💡 AI 題材與資本支出： - AI 泡沫： 判斷 AI 泡沫尚在醞釀過程，而非已屆頂峰。 - AI 巨頭關係： AI 巨頭如 Microsoft、Nvidia（NVDA）、AMD（AMD）、Oracle（ORCL）等同時具備消費者、製造商、投資者等多重角色。 - 大型 CSP 訂單： Microsoft（MSFT）和 Oracle 的剩餘履約義務（RPO）成長多來自 OpenAI。 - 資本支出（Capex）放緩： 主要 CSP 公司（AMZN、GOOGL、MSFT、META）的資本支出預估增速將在 2026 年放緩，但 2027 年將回升。 - 💸 籌碼與技術分析： - 外資動向： 外資採「高出低進」策略。投信自 2025 年 7 月、外資自 2025 年 10 月起轉為累計賣超。 - 內資動能： 證券劃撥餘額大幅創高，顯示市場資金動能強勁。 - 技術面： 加權指數長多慣性不變，但短線將漲多逢壓整理，波段漲勢近尾聲。櫃買指數（OTC）再挑戰高連高壓力。 - 🎯 2026 年選股策略： - 電子產業（台股）： - AI 供應鏈： 關注 GPU、自研晶片及 Rubin 規格升級，建議個股包括台積電（2330）、創意（3443）、世芯-KY（3661）、台達電（2308）、勤誠（8210）。 - 記憶體： 受惠 AI 需求帶動的超級循環，如華邦電（2344）、群聯（8299）。 - 電能： AI 時代對電力需求高，關注亞通（6179）、雲豹能源（6869）。 - 傳統產業（台股）： - 運動休閒： 產業調整落底，受惠世足賽（如振大環球 4441）。 - 汽車零件： AM 件滲透率提升（如東陽 1319、堤維西 1522）。🌟 市場反應與分析師評級摘要:本文件為兆豐國際投顧的投資展望報告，並未包含第三方分析師或市場對其展望的即時評級或反應。報告內容本身即為兆豐投顧對 2026 年投資策略及選股建議的摘要與評級。🔖 Keywords: \#AI \#台股展望 \#高評價 \#箱型整理 \#資通訊產業 TSMC NVDA AMD",2025-11-29 02:29:44.265000+00:00,https://social.mikala.one/notes/afn8mhmx8p2b09li,AI,0,,zh-tw,"In 2026, the investment strategy looked at the development of a high level of basic education, higher education, and higher education.
