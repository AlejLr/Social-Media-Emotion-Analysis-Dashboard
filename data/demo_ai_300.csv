115563639679989779,mastodon,ramchristiansuperable@tbc-news.com,"Scientists Reveal Coffee’s Dark Side You Didn’t Know AboutA new study has raised concerns about the link between coffee consumption and cancer, suggesting that a daily habit long considered harmless could carry unexpected risks.Researchers using Mendelian randomisation, a method that examines genetic predispositions to coffee consumption, found that higher genetically predicted coffee intake was strongly associated with esophageal cancer, with an odds ratio of 2.79. Dr. Peter Carter, lead author of the study, said, “We provide strong support for a causal association of coffee consumption with oesophageal cancer … the underlying mechanisms require investigation.”The analysis also indicated potential links to multiple myeloma, while suggesting a reduced risk for ovarian cancer.Despite this alarming headline, the broader body of research presents a more nuanced picture.Observational studies spanning decades consistently show that coffee may actually reduce the risk of several types of cancer.A 2011 meta-analysis covering 40 independent cohort studies found that each additional cup of coffee per day was associated with a 3% lower overall cancer risk.Specific cancers appear particularly responsive to coffee’s protective effects. Endometrial cancer risk, for example, has been shown to drop by up to 29% among high coffee consumers, according to a 2022 meta-analysis. Liver cancer also shows strong inverse associations with regular coffee intake.Nutrition scientist Dr. Lina Chen noted, “Coffee contains hundreds of bioactive compounds, including antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents, which likely contribute to its protective effect against certain cancers.”The contrasting results between genetic and observational studies may reflect differences in methodology.Mendelian randomisation can reveal causal risks in specific cancers, while observational studies may be influenced by lifestyle factors, such as diet, alcohol, and smoking habits.For now, experts emphasize moderation rather than avoidance. Coffee’s benefits for liver, endometrial, and other cancers remain significant, while its potential risk for esophageal cancer warrants caution, particularly with very hot beverages.The evidence suggests coffee is neither a universal danger nor an unequivocal safeguard against cancer, but understanding its effects more precisely could guide healthier consumption habits worldwide.#ai #business #coffee #events #latest #lifestyle #news #philippines #technology",2025-11-17 06:33:18+00:00,https://tbc-news.com/2025/11/17/scientists-reveal-coffees-dark-side-you-didnt-know-about/,AI,0,,en,"Scientists Reveal Coffee’s Dark Side You Didn’t Know AboutA new study has raised concerns about the link between coffee consumption and cancer, suggesting that a daily habit long considered harmless could carry unexpected risks.Researchers using Mendelian randomisation, a method that examines genetic predispositions to coffee consumption, found that higher genetically predicted coffee intake was strongly associated with esophageal cancer, with an odds ratio of 2.79.

Purpose는 회사의 더 큰 세계 변화 목표를, N-year Vision은 장기적인 미래 상태를, Next Milestone은 단기적이고 구체적인 실행 목표를 각각 정의합니다. 이를 통해 조직은 명확한 방향성과 실질적인 행동 전략을 갖출 수 있으며, 목적 중심의 기업은 충성 고객, 열정적인 직원, 회복력 등 다양한 이점을 얻을 수 있습니다. 하지만 모든 성공 기업이 목적 중심이 아니더라도, 목적에서 파생된 정체성과 행동은 여전히 큰 의미를 지닌다고 강조합니다.https://news.hada.io/topic?id=24417#ai",2025-11-17 02:38:57+00:00,https://mastodon.sayzard.site/@sayzard/115562717989783040,AI,0,,ko,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .,0.0,neutral
